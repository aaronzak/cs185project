Final project for CS185 at UCSB

EasyA

EasyA is a notetaking and picture taking app designed for students. This application is meant to organize notes and pictures
into different folders based on semester and class. This helps students keep track of where their notes and academic pictures
are.

Our user takes dozens of photos every week, but only a small portion of them are school related. These can 
easily get lost in all the pictures of parties, scenery, friends, and events. In this case, the user will use this 
app to organize academic photos. S/he will open the app and create a folder for a specific quarter, then create a 
folder for each course for that quarter. Now if the user wants to jot down notes or take a picture for a specific 
course, s/he will go to that course and choose to create a new note or new photo. When itâ€™s finals week, the user 
can look through the course that s/he is studying for and find all related materials in one convenient location.
